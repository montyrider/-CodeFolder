Benvolio: We do not make lengthy explanations or introduce our selves, we will go there and give a good dance, and leave.\n
Romeo: Give me the torch I do not want to dance. I feel sad; Let me be the one who carries the light.\n
Mercutio: Noble Romeo, you have to dance.\n
Romeo: Believe me, you are the one wearing dancing shoes!\n
Mercutio: You're a lover. Take Cupid's wings, and fly higher than the average man.\n
Romeo: I have been pierced to deeply with Cupid's arrow making me sink in the weight of love.\n
Benvolio: Come, knock and enter. And sooner in let's start dancing.\n
Romeo: And we mean well in going to this mask, but it's not smart of us to go.\n
Mercutio: Why, may I ask?\n
Romeo: I had a dream last night.\n
Mercutio: So did I.\n
Romeo: Well, what was your dream?\n
Mercutio: That dreamers often lie.\n
Romeo: In bed asleep while they do dream things true.\n
Mercutio: Oh, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.\n
Benvolio: Queen Mab, what's she,\n
Mercutio:She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes\n
In shape no bigger than an agate stone\n
On the forefinger of an alderman,\n
Drawn with a team of little atomi\n
Over men’s noses as they lie asleep\n.
Her wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs,\n
The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,\n
Her traces of the smallest spider’s web,\n
Her collars of the moonshine’s watery beams,\n
Her whip of cricket’s bone, the lash of film,\n
Her wagoner a small gray-coated gnat,\n
Not half so big as a round little worm\n
Pricked from the lazy finger of a maid.\n
Her chariot is an empty hazelnut\n
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,\n
Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.\n
And in this state she gallops night by night\n
Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;\n
On courtiers' knees, that dream on curtsies straight;\n
O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;\n
O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,\n
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,\n
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.\n
Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier’s nose,\n
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit.\n
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s tail\n
Tickling a parson’s nose as he lies asleep,\n
Then he dreams of another benefice.\n
Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier’s neck,\n
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,\n
Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,\n
Of healths five fathom deep, and then anon\n
Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,\n
And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two\n
And sleeps again. This is that very Mab\n
That plaits the manes of horses in the night\n
And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,\n
Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes.\n
This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,\n
That presses them and learns them first to bear,\n
Making them women of good carriage.\n
This is she—\n

Romeo: Peace Mercutio, peace! Thou talk'st of nothing.\n
Mercutio: True, I'm talking about dreams, which are the products of a brain that's doing nothing.\n
Dreams are nothing but silly imagination, as thin as air and less predictable than the wind,\n
which sometimes blows on the frozen north and then gets angry and blows south.\n
Benvolio: The wind you talk of, blows us from ourselves. Supper is done, and we shall come too late.\n
Romeo: I'm worried we'll get there to early. I have a feeling this party tonight will be the start of something bad,\n
something that is in charge of my own death. But whoever's in charge of where my life's going can steer me wherever they\n
want. Onward, lover boys!\n
